"What is the ""hot Neptunian desert""?",A region with many hot Neptunes,A lack of Neptune-sized planets found close to their stars,A cold area in space,An area with no planets,A lack of Neptune-sized planets found close to their stars.
What is a rogue planet?,A planet with a star,A moon of a planet,A free-floating planet,A planet with rings,A planet not gravitationally bound to any star.
How might rogue planets become isolated?,By drifting away slowly,By being flung out of their systems by gravitational interactions.,By merging with stars,By losing their atmospheres,By being flung out of their systems by gravitational interactions.

What are the primary materials composing terrestrial exoplanets?,Gas and ice,Rock and iron,Water and hydrogen,Ice and metal,Rock and iron.
Why are hot Jupiters so light in terms of density?,They have low gravity,"Their proximity to their stars causes them to ""puff out.""",They are very far from stars,They have many moons,"Their proximity to their stars causes them to ""puff out."""
What could be a reason for the migration of hot Jupiters closer to their stars?,They may form farther out and then migrate inward.,They never move,They are pulled in by black holes,They merge with other planets,They may form farther out and then migrate inward.
"What does the term ""Super-Earth"" imply about a planet's size and mass?",It is smaller than Earth,It is larger than Earth but smaller than ice giants or gas giants.,It is the same size as Earth,It is a gas giant,It is larger than Earth but smaller than ice giants or gas giants.
What could be the cause of rogue planets wandering alone?,They are looking for stars,Gravitational interactions within their planetary systems.,They are lost,They are too cold,Gravitational interactions within their planetary systems.
What is one key difference between exoplanets and the planets in our solar system?,Exoplanets are larger,Exoplanets are made of ice,Exoplanets have no moons,Exoplanets are more diverse and disordered compared to our solar system.,Exoplanets are more diverse and disordered compared to our solar system.
